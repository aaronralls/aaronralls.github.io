# Fort Smith Tech User Group

<p>The Fort Smith Tech User Group is now active!</p>
<p>In this post, I wanted to share the vision of the group and recap our first meeting.</p>
<p>First, I wanted to thank some people that helped get this User Group going.</p>
<p>Abby Sims from the<a href="http://lrdnug.org"> Little Rock .Net Users Group</a> and Sean Sparkman from the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DFW-Mobile-NET/">Dallas/Fort Worth </a>Mobile .Net Users Group. These two shared with me their unique insights into running their respective groups.</p>
<p>Randy Friend from the previous Fort Smith .Net Users Group who answered numerous questions about what worked and did not work with the previous group that stopped meeting.</p>
<p>This month we have to thank the <a href="http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/arkansas/hampton-inn-fort-smith-FSMARHX/event/index.html">Hampton Inn</a> on Rogers ave in Fort Smith for providing the meeting space. If you need to host an event or are looking for a place to stay look no further! Speak with Amanda Webb to help you arrange an event.</p>
<p>Jordan Lerch, a local freelance filmographer, took photos of the event to help with social media promotions. Be sure to check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZk8mU_rkLQaS1r2_gvk7w">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JLFilmography/">Facebook</a> pages if you are looking to hire someone to promote your business he can help with promotional or music videos, interviews, or any sort of informative and creative content.</p>

<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<p>We are here to share knowledge and to help with your IT career. There is no technology topic too big or too small for the group.</p>
<p>Additional, we are looking to partner with small businesses and organizations that give back to the community. We will seek to help promote and use the services they provide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>User Group Meeting Recap</h2>
<p>At our first meeting, we had about twelve members and spent some time getting to know each other. We met some old friends and made some new ones.</p>
<p>I presented on application security and how to get started quickly using open source software <a href="http://docs.identityserver.io/en/release/">IdentityServer4</a>. It was a high-level overview of the <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> and <a href="http://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> standards and how we should all be aware of the differences between Authorization and Authentication. To learn more about creating API's see my blog <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2017/10/17/rest-api-example-c-asp-net-core/">post</a> on professional API's.</p>
<p>One of our members, Aaron Price owner of <a href="https://gadgetgrave.com/">Gadget Grave</a>, has a vision of giving back to the community with a coding camp for kids. We discussed ideas on how we could get something started. If this is something you would be interested in helping with or starting with your group stay tuned for more details!</p>
<h2>Get Involved with Fort Smith Tech User Group</h2>
<p>The Fort Smith Tech User Group is here to share IT knowledge,<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2018/02/12/microsoft-azure-training-pluralsight/"> training opportunities</a> and experiences. Check out the group to meet new people and have fun learning!</p>
<p>We meet the third Thursday of every month and are open to the public.</p>
